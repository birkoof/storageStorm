# StorageStorm 
- An android application as a graphical front-end for the "[NoSQL DBMS based on a new Data Model](https://coronet.iicm.tugraz.at/wbtmaster/roomLibC.htm?ru_master)" project, which was a cooperation between students from the [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/home/) and students from the [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/).
- The basic idea was to create a mobile client that will allow insight into the [Ikarus DB](https://github.com/RHohensinner/bakk_19), manipulation of the database content, as well as all other functionalities provided by [Ikarus Utilities](https://github.com/Donutellko/IkarusUtilities).
- The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/birkoof/storageStorm/blob/master/StorageStorm%20-%20documentation.pdf).
